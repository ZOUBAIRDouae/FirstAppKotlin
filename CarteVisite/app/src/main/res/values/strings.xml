    <string name="description_place">The waterfall of Ras el-Maa is just beyond the far Northeastern gate of Chefchaouen Medina. Itâ€™s here, where the water comes gushing out of the mountain, that local women come to do their washing. The sound of the water and the verdant hills provide a sudden, strong dose of nature.</string>
